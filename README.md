# Introduction to Robotics (2022 - 2023)
Introduction to Robotics laboratory homework, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.

## Homework #0 : Setup

**Task Requirements:** create and setup a public GitHub repository containing info about the current and future homework for this course, and install the Arduino IDE.

## Homework #1 : RGB Led Controlled by Three Potentiometers

**Task Requirements:** Use three separate potentiometers in controlling each of the color of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done
with digital electronics (aka you must read the value of the potentiometer with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected
to the led).

**Components Used:**
* 1 RBG LED
* 3 potentiometers
* resistors and wires (per logic)
